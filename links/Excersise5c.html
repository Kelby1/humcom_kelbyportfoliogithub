        <font face="Arial" size="4" color="black">The dessert is the local Filipino adaptation of the Spanish dish manjar blanco (blancmange), but it has become distinct in that it uses very different ingredients, like coconut milk instead of milk or almond milk. The dish was most popular in Luzon, especially in Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinense, and Ilocano cuisine. But it was also popular in the south, especially among Chavacano-speaking Zamboangueños.
            Maja blanca takes its name from the flamboyant majas of 18th- and 19th-century Spanish society. Maja blanca is also known as dudul in Ilocano; as well as maja blanca con maíz, maja maíz, or maja blanca maíz when corn kernels are used in the preparation (maíz is Spanish for corn).</font></div>
